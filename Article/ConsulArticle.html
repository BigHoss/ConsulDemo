<h1><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Are Madonna once said &quot;we are living in a micro services world&quot;. Ok she 
didn't quite say that, but what does she know. We <strong>ARE</strong> living in 
a micro services world.</p>
<p>If you are currently doing/have done microservices you will know that one of 
the trickier elements to this is &quot;Service Discovery&quot;. This article will briefly 
talk about some existing solutions to this, and will spend the rest of the 
article talking about on particular framework for aiding in this area called &quot;<code>Consul</code>&quot;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a name="Problem-we-are-trying-to-solve" id="Problem-we-are-trying-to-solve">Problem we are trying to solve</a></h1>
<p>So what is the problem exactly. Lets consider this image</p>
<p><img alt="" height="369" src="TheProblemWeAreTryingToSolve.png" width="630"></p>
<p>Say we have a bunch of services out in the wild SystemB/SystemC in this 
example, and we have other services (or UIs) SystemA/SystemD in this example, 
that want to make use of the existsing services. However in order to do that we 
need to know where these existing services live, or make some assumptions about 
their DNS names that should be long lived. This the act of &quot;discovery&quot;, and is 
essentially what the rest of this article will focus on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a name="Existing-solutions" id="Existing-solutions">Existing solutions</a></h1>
<p>There are quite a few frameworks that may aid in the development of&nbsp; 
&quot;discovery&quot; mechanisms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Zookeeper" id="Zookeeper">Zookeeper</a></h2>
<p>Zookeeper has server nodes that require a quorum of nodes to operate (usually 
a simple majority). They are strongly-consistent and expose various primitives 
that can be used through client libraries within applications to build complex 
distributed systems. The problem with this, is that while it offers absolute 
freedom its all down to you to do/build.</p>
<h2><a name="Redis/DataStore" id="Redis/DataStore">Redis/DataStore</a></h2>
<p>You could use Redis cache to be used by services to store meta data, and then 
a consumer could query the cache. However to make this resilient you really need 
some form of clustering, and some consensus/gossip to achieve consistency. This 
is fairly hard so most people just cut corners and make this a singleton, which 
is obviously a single point of failure.</p>
<h2><a name="Kubernetes" id="Kubernetes">Kubernetes</a></h2>
<p>Kubernetes does a good job of &quot;Disvovery&quot; by way of Services/DNS addon/pods 
all of which can easily be load balanced (providing you're using a cloud hosted 
Kubernetes). I have written about this before, so if you are interested you can 
read more here : <a href="https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/kubernetes-series/">
https://sachabarbs.wordpress.com/kubernetes-series/</a></p>
<p>This is a great solution, providing your stuff is running in containers 
(prefferably in a cloud environment)</p>
<h2><a name="Consul" id="Consul">Consul</a></h2>
<p><code>Consul </code>(to my mind) is the only tool/framework that tackles 
&quot;discovery&quot; head on, and actually provides a rich tool that does that this job, 
and does it well, with little effort from the developer. This page is actually a 
pretty good read of the comparisons between <code>Consul </code>and others :
<a href="https://www.consul.io/intro/vs/index.html" target="_blank">
https://www.consul.io/intro/vs/index.html</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the remainder of the article I will be concentrating on <code>Consul</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="Consul-discussion" id="Consul-discussion">Consul discussion</a></h1>
<p>So before we get into the demo app, lets just spend a bit of time talking 
about what <code>Consul </code>is, who created it, and why I think it's ace.</p>
<h2><a name="Who-created-Consul,-why-should-we-trust-it?" id="Who-created-Consul,-why-should-we-trust-it?">Who created Consul, why should we trust it?</a></h2>
<p><code>Consul </code>was created by Hashicorp, who are the same team that made 
Vagrant (which is a awesome VM registry system,). Hashicorp know what they are 
doing, they have a proven track record of great products. So yes you can trust 
them, they have your back.</p>
<h2><a name="The-basic-idea" id="The-basic-idea">The basic idea</a></h2>
<p>The main points of <code>Consul </code>are these</p>
<ul>
	<li>Provide a way of registering services with a catalog, along with 
	queryable metadata</li>
	<li>Provide a way of querying the catalog using metadata</li>
	<li>Provide the ability to health check services</li>
	<li>Provide a KeyValue store</li>
	<li>Exposes a way to setup ACLs (access control lists)</li>
	<li>Exposes a way to create distributed Semaphore.&nbsp; This is useful when 
	you want to coordinate many services while restricting access to certain 
	resources. See here for more information :
	<a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/semaphore.html" target="_blank">
	https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/semaphore.html</a>, and also refer to the 
	relevant Client library for the exact language example that you need</li>
	<li>Exposes a way to use <code>Consul </code>to create your own client side 
	leader election. See here for more information :
	<a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/leader-election.html" target="_blank">
	https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/leader-election.html</a>, and also refer 
	to the relevant Client library for the exact language example that you need</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Is-it-reliable?" id="Is-it-reliable?">Is it reliable?</a></h2>
<p>At is heart <code>Consul </code>is expecting you to set you to set up a 
cluster where there is a gossip protocol in place between the cluster nodes.
<code>Consul </code>uses <a href="https://www.serf.io/" target="_blank">Serf</a> 
(see <a href="https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/gossip.html" target="_blank">
https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/gossip.html</a>, btw Serf is another 
Hashicorp product) to handle the gossiping. Essentially there will some form of 
consensus/leadship/consistency/replication that is handled by the gossiping 
between nodes, this is what will give it the reliability.</p>
<h2><a name="Client-libraries" id="Client-libraries">Client libraries</a></h2>
<p><code>Consul </code>as stated above exposes a REST API/Go client to allow you 
get your own services/KeyValues/ACLs into the <code>Consul </code>machinery. You 
can totally use these REST APIs/Go client no problem, there are however a great 
number of community based clients that wrap the <code>Consul </code>REST APIs 
for you, so it may be worth having a look at these.</p>
<p>You can see the full list of clients here :
<a href="https://www.consul.io/api/libraries-and-sdks.html" target="_blank">
https://www.consul.io/api/libraries-and-sdks.html</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Web-dashboard" id="Web-dashboard">Web dashboard</a></h2>
<p>If you are running a <code>Consul </code>agent you should be able to get to a 
web dashboard which should look like this out of the box (NOTE that I have 
created the following environment variable <code>CONSUL_UI_BETA</code> wihch is 
set to <code>true</code>, to use the &quot;new UI&quot;)</p>
<p>Navigate to <code>http:localhost:8500</code></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" height="354" src="ConsulWebUIOfOfTheBox.png" width="630"></p>
<p>This web UI allows you to see the following</p>
<ul>
	<li>Registered services</li>
	<li>The cluster nodes</li>
	<li>The Key/Values for the KeyValueStore</li>
	<li>Any ACL (Access Control List) values you have setup</li>
</ul>
<p>We will look at this web app again, once I show you how to use&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/PlayFab/consuldotnet" target="_blank">
Consul.NET</a>, to self register with <code>Consul</code></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a name="Demo-app-using-Consul.Net" id="Demo-app-using-Consul.Net">Demo app using Consul.Net</a></h1>
<p>As stated above there are many Consul REST wrappers, but I chose to show the 
.NET one, which uses <a href="https://github.com/PlayFab/consuldotnet" target="_blank">
Consul.NET</a>, it is a .NET Core 2.0 WebAPI and simple Console app client</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The demo app does the following things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Shows how to self register an API with <code>Consul</code></li>
	<li>Shows how to hookup an API health check with <code>Consul</code></li>
	<li>Shows how to use the <code>Consul</code>KeyValue store</li>
	<li>Shows how a client can us the <code>Consul</code>Catalog to discover 
	services</li>
	<li>Shows the client using a &quot;discovered&quot; API</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although <a href="https://github.com/PlayFab/consuldotnet" target="_blank">
Consul.NET</a> is available via NuGet its probably still good to familiarise 
yourself with the tests/API, which you can read about at its GitHub repo.</p>
<h2><a name="&nbsp;" id="&nbsp;">&nbsp;</a></h2>
<h2><a name="Demo-app-prerequisites" id="Demo-app-prerequisites">Demo app prerequisites</a></h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.consul.io/downloads.html" target="_blank">Consul.IO 
	download</a>, just make sure consul.exe is available on your path</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Running-The-Demo" id="Running-The-Demo">Running The Demo</a></h2>
<p>You can grab the code for this article from my repo :
<a href="https://github.com/sachabarber/ConsulDemo" target="_blank">
https://github.com/sachabarber/ConsulDemo</a>, once you download that just do 
the following 2 things:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Open a command prompt window to where you have the <code>consul.exe</code> 
	and issue this command <code>consul agent -dev</code>. This will start a 
	single node to try stuff out against. This data will not survive a <code>Consul</code>restart. As such this is obviously not fit for production, its 
	just so you can try stuff out. Teaching you about clusters is outside the 
	scope of this article, please just refer to the docs for that :
	<a href="https://www.consul.io/intro/getting-started/join.html" target="_blank">
	https://www.consul.io/intro/getting-started/join.html</a></li>
	<li>Open the code from the repo above in Visual Studio, and ensure that you 
	run the projects in this order<ul>
		<li><code>ConsulDemoApi</code>, just wait for the API page to launch in a brwoser and show an empty JSON array response (this is the starting point for the demo app, the client will provide some items when it discovers and uses the API)</li>
		<li><code>ConsulDemoApi.Client</code>, once you are sure the API is running, press a key in the clients console to allow to to discover and use the API via 
		<code>Consul</code></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>That is all there is to it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="An-example-API" id="An-example-API">An example API</a></h2>
<p>The example API could be anything to be fair, its more about how to register 
it with Consul. However I kind of wanted to also show how to use the Consul 
KeyValue store, so have gone for a simple .NET Core 2.0 WebApi project, which 
has 2 controllers</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>ValuesController </code>: Which is a simple controller that 
	expects to PUT/GET/DELETE items from the <code>Consul </code>KeyValue store</li>
	<li><code>HealthController </code>: This is used by the <code>Consul </code>
	health check associated with the registration of this overall service with <code>Consul </code></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="API-controller" id="API-controller">API controller</a></h3>
<p>This is the entire code for the <code>ValuesController </code>which I think 
is fairly self explanatory. The <code>Consul </code>KeyValue store is that easy 
to use via&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/PlayFab/consuldotnet" target="_blank">
Consul.NET</a> </p>

<p>There honestly is not much more to say about this controller, its simple REST 
over the KeyValue store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Registration/health-checks" id="Registration/health-checks">Registration/health checks</a></h3>
<p>Ok so now that we have an API, we would like to register it with <code>Consul</code>. 
This is the good stuff. Lets see how we do that</p>
<p>It roughly breaks down to these steps (remember I am using .NET Core 2.0, so 
this may vary for you if that is not what you are using)</p>
<h4><a name="Create-some-config" id="Create-some-config">Create some config</a></h4>
<p>This is my minimal <code>appsettings.json</code> file for my local <code>Consul</code></p>
<pre lang="jscript">
{
  "ConsulConfig": {
    "Address": "http://127.0.0.1:8500",
    "ServiceName": "ConsulDemoApi",
    "ServiceID": "ConsulDemoApi-v1"
  }
}
<p>See how this contains a service name / ID (ID MUST be unique)</p>
</pre>
<h4><a name="Register-the-service" id="Register-the-service">Register the service</a></h4>
<p>The next step is to register the service. There are many ways to do this, but .NET Core 2.0 comes with this neat iterface <code>IHostedService</code> which 
allows me to register start up tasks with the http pipeline.</p>
<p>So its simply a matter of adding some registration code in an <code>IHostedService</code>&nbsp; 
implementation. Here is the demo app one</p>
<pre lang="csharp">

        }
    }
}

<p>The main point of the code is obviously to register THIS service with Consul. 
So make sure you understand the register section in the code above.&nbsp; The 
most important point I think is also how extra metadata is associated with the 
registration, this allows a consumer to query using this metadata without 
knowing anything about the actual endpoint (which is what we are trying to 
ascertain after all), we simple go &quot;<strong>I want all services called 
'ConsulDemoApi'</strong>&quot;, and we would get a response of all such tags services 
registered with <code>Consul</code>, which would include the endpoint information for the service in the response, which may then be used by the calling consumer.</p>
<p>See 
how the registration also includes a <code>Check Consul</code> comes with many 
flavors of <code>Check </code>and this is just one that will call a REST 
endpoint, in this case one that is part of this app the <code>HealthController</code> which looks like this</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

namespace ConsulDemoApi.Controllers
{
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class HealthController : Controller
    {
        [HttpGet("status")]
        public IActionResult Status() =&gt; Ok();
    }
}</pre>
<p>For a full list of the different types of Check available read here :

https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/checks.html</a></p>
<h4><a name="Bootstrap-the-IOC-container" id="Bootstrap-the-IOC-container">Bootstrap the IOC container</a></h4>
<p>The final step is to ensure the correct services are registered in the IOC 
container (this may vary depending on your setup)</p>
<p>Since I am using .NET Core 2.0 WebAPI, for the demo app this is done as 
follows in <code>Startup.cs</code></p>

        consulConfig.Address = new Uri(address);
    }));

    services.AddSingleton&gt;Func&gt;IConsulClient&gt;&gt;(p =&gt; () =&gt; new ConsulClient(consulConfig =&gt;
    {
        var address = Configuration["ConsulConfig:Address"];
        consulConfig.Address = new Uri(address);
    }));

<h2><a name="An-example-client" id="An-example-client">An example client</a></h2>
<p>So the example client is a simple .NET core 2.0 Console app that does the 
following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Discovers 1-N services using the <code>Consul </code>query mechanism 
	(where we use metadata about the service we want to discover and use)</li>
	<li>Deletes all previous values CURRENT discivered service</li>
	<li>Puts some new values using the CURRENT discovered service</li>
	<li>Gets all the new values using the CURRENT discovered service</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="Get-metadata-using-the-Catalog" id="Get-metadata-using-the-Catalog">Get metadata using the Catalog</a></h3>
<p>The hard part (well its actually quite easy) is to discover the services that 
match a given set of metadata. This is done as follows:</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
private readonly List&lt;Uri&gt; _serverUrls;


public async Task Initialize()
{
    var consulClient = new ConsulClient(c =&gt;
    {
        var uri = new Uri(_configuration["ConsulConfig:Address"]);
        c.Address = uri;
    });

    _logger.LogInformation("Discovering Services from Consul.");

    var services = await consulClient.Agent.Services();
    foreach (var service in services.Response)
    {
        var isDemoApi = service.Value.Tags.Any(t =&gt; t == "Consul") &amp;&amp;
            service.Value.Tags.Any(t =&gt; t == "SachaBarber-Demo");
        if (isDemoApi)
        {
            var serviceUri = new Uri($"{service.Value.Address}:{service.Value.Port}");
            _serverUrls.Add(serviceUri);
        }
    }

    ....
}</pre>
<p>See how we use the <code>Tags</code> to provide a predicate for the search. Then we simply store the endpoint information that matches that query into a list so we can then use the discovered services later</p>
<h3><a name="Retries-and-switchover-using-Polly" id="Retries-and-switchover-using-Polly">Retries and switchover using Polly</a></h3>
<p>One neat trick here is that we can make use of the Polly retry library, such 
that after a certain amount of retries we could switch over to the next service 
that we discovered. This is quite common in trading apps, where there might be 
loads of price streaming services and if one dies we go to the next.</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
serverRetryPolicy = Policy.Handle&lt;HttpRequestException&gt;()
    .RetryAsync(retries, (exception, retryCount) =&gt;
    {
        ChooseNextServer(retryCount);
    });
	
private void ChooseNextServer(int retryCount)
{
    if (retryCount % 2 == 0)
    {
        _logger.LogWarning("Trying next server... \n");
        _currentConfigIndex++;

        if (_currentConfigIndex &gt; _serverUrls.Count - 1)
            _currentConfigIndex = 0;
    }
}

	
</pre>
<p>Then for the calls to use the discovered service we can simply use the curent "working" service endpoint informaton</p>
<pre lang="csharp">
public Task&lt;bool&gt; DeleteValueAsync(int id)
{
    return _serverRetryPolicy.ExecuteAsync(async () =&gt;
    {
        var serverUrl = _serverUrls[_currentConfigIndex];
        var requestPath = $"{serverUrl}api/values/{id}";
        _logger.LogInformation($"Making request to DELETE {requestPath}");
        var response = await _apiClient.DeleteAsync(requestPath).ConfigureAwait(false);
        return response.IsSuccessStatusCode;
    });
}
</pre>

<p>Now that we have a demo app, and we have started <code>Consul </code>(from 
command line <code>consul agent -dev</code>) we can let it run and have a look 
at the <code>Consul </code>web UI again</p>
<p>First ensure you have started Consul and run both the demo app projects, you 
should see output like this</p>
<p><img alt="" height="383" src="output.png" width="630"></p>
<p>Then lets launch the <code>Consul </code>web app again, we can now see our 
registered service (remember the <code>-dev</code> flag on <code>Consul </code>
starts a NON persisted <code>Consul </code>single node cluster, so you will not 
see anything after a machine restart)</p>
<p><img alt="" height="354" src="WebUIAfterRun1.png" width="630"></p>
<p>We can drill into our new service registration, and we see our health check 
is working too</p>
<p><img alt="" height="354" src="WebUIAfterRun2.png" width="630"></p>
<p>We also made use of the KeyValue store, so lets see that</p>
<p><img alt="" height="354" src="WebUIAfterRun3.png" width="630"></p>
<p>Where we can also look at one of the values</p>
<p><img alt="" height="354" src="WebUIAfterRun4.png" width="630"></p>
<p>Yay its all working just as we want it to. And that ladies and gents is a 
wrap.</p>

<p>Consul is a dream to use, and if you have not done so already you should 
really take a look. Its awesome</p>
